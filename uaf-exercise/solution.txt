solution uaf0.c

Goal:

The program generates the random key and it saved it on the heap at different position.
Then the program free such allocation. 

By using memory leak through the function the attacker can still use the
previous free allocated memory and try to extract the key from the memory and
use it. (Use after Free)


Soluzione:

* Provide the address of the memory allocated memory by malloc + 16 that should still
  contain a valid copy of the secret. 

* When the program ask the address compute the pointer to the allocate memory
  0x804B008 + 0x10 (16) and insert the integer value = 134524952, then insert
the key printed on the screen.
